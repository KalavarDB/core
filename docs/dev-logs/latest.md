# Devlog #1
## Meet Kalavar

Hi everybody, in this dev log i wanted to take the time to introduce to you, our little project. We like to call it Kalavar and this is where you read the latest information and developer updates about the system, as we work our way towards a public alpha test release. We hope you enjoy this journey just as much as we will.

## What is Kalavar?
Kalavar is an asynchronous, efficient, and secure database system, programmed using the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language and built upon the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) runtime.

## What does it offer that X does not?
Kalavar, once ready for a release candidate, will be able to offer a full featured SQL-less query environment, designed to provide asynchronous access to your data, via encrypted data streams. What does that actually mean? well, it means that Kalavar, simply out-classes the competition via the sheer power of asynchronous programming. Queries can be organised and optimised before  being submitted by the client for processing, this allows your queries to be as fast, efficient, and secure as you could ever wish for.

And, on top of this, Kalavar's official clients will also be capable of taking your regular old SQL queries* and transforming them into faster, more efficient KQL queries, before sending them off for processing!

<sup>*SQL transformation limited to PostgreSQL queries. Not all features will be available at time of release. these features will be provided via a downloadable update once they are ready for use</sup>

## Parting words
Well, that's it folks, the first developer log is now finished, we hope you enjoyed reading our plans for Kalavar, and we also ask you to keep an eye on this space for more information, as development goes further.

For now though, goodbye from the Kalavar team
